# 🧠 Sorting Visualizer

An interactive web-based **Sorting Visualizer** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project visually demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work by animating the sorting process using bars of varying heights.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧩 Visualizes multiple sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort).
- 🎚️ Adjustable number of bars using a slider.
- ⏱️ Dynamic speed control for animation.
- 🔄 Regenerate array with a single click.
- 🎨 Color-coded bars to show comparisons, swaps, and sorted positions.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Structure  
- **CSS3** – Styling and layout  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Logic and interactivity  
- **DOM Manipulation** – For real-time updates
